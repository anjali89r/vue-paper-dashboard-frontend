## Build Setup

### install dependencies
```
npm install
```
## Run api solution

```
Please follow the steps described in git:

[Dashboard Go Rest API](https://github.com/anjali89r/dashboard-go-rest-api.git)

Make sure api solution is running at localhost:8000 or else if you need to change the port number at Vue.prototype.$baseURL in the file "@src/main.js"
```
### serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
```
npm run dev
```
### build for production with minification
```
npm run build
```
## Note

```
The log in page is only configured to work with user login
email: anjali@email.com, 
password: test1234

This is hardcoded in api solution. If there is any CORS error, then the ip address need to be updated in the handler of api solution 
```
